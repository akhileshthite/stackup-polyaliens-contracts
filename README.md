This solidity smart contract file is a flattened ERC721 [OpenZeppelin](https://www.openzeppelin.com/) contract. It's a single file that contains all the code of the ERC721 smart contract from the OpenZeppelin library. The code is flattened by combining all the dependencies and imports into one single file for easier deployment and verification. It is a commonly used library for creating and deploying non-fungible token (NFT) contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. By using OpenZeppelin's pre-audited and secure code, developers can save time and ensure that their NFT contracts are secure and reliable.
